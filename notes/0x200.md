# 0x200

```C
// Hello World in C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    puts("Hello, world!\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile using gcc
```bash
gcc hello.c
```

It should generate an executable binary, to run that 

```bash
./a.out
```

Disassemble the binary to look at the assembly
```bash
objdump -D a.out
```

It should spit out a lot of asm code which might not be relevant to you at this stage, if you want to get the relevant piece
just grep the main procedure. -M flag for specifying intel syntax

```bash
objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A20 main.:
```

If you want to step through the program, debug or look at the state of registers you can also use [gdb](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/pointers/summary.html)  

```bash
gdb -q ./a.out
```

The above command should open the gdb console and you can type commands inside the gdb console -> (gdb) now  
set a [breakpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint) and run

```bash
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
```
Examine the registers
```bash
(gdb) info registers
```

Quit
```bash
(gdb) quit
```


### [General Purpose Registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register)
Think of a registers as a variable in the processor.  

EAX - Accumulator  
ECX - Counter  
EDX - Data  
EBX - Base  

The below ones are also general purpose registers but sometimes these are referred as pointers and indexes.  

ESP - Stack Pointer  
EBP - Base Pointer  
ESI - Source Index  
EDI - Destination Index  

EIP - Instruction Pointer
