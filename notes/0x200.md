# 0x200

```C
// Hello World in C
#include <stdio.h>

int main() {
  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
    puts("Hello, world!\n");
  }
  return 0;
}
```

Compile using gcc
```bash
gcc hello.c
```

It should generate an executable binary, to run that 

```bash
./a.out
```

Disassemble the binary to look at the assembly
```bash
objdump -D a.out
```

It should spit out a lot of asm code which might not be relevant to you at this stage, if you want to get the relevant piece
just grep the main procedure. -M flag for specifying intel syntax

```bash
objdump -M intel -D a.out | grep -A20 main.:
```

If you want to step through the program, debug or look at the state of registers you can also use [gdb](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~sugih/pointers/summary.html)  

```bash
gdb -q ./a.out
```

The above command should open the gdb console and you can type commands inside the gdb console -> (gdb) now  
set a [breakpoint](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Breakpoint) and run

```bash
(gdb) break main
(gdb) run
```

you may have noticed that when you run in gdb, you don't get to see any source code, you can fix that by generating 
extra debug info while compiling using -g flag in gcc.

```c
Breakpoint 1, main () at hello.c:4
4	  for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
```

Examine the registers
```bash
(gdb) info registers
```

You can examine specific registers by speciyfing the register name  
I am examining the program counter here  
Remember it is different based on your program architecture

16 bit - ip  
32 bit - eip  
64 bit - rip  

```bash
(gdb) info registers eip
```

gdb also lets you use a variable $pc instead of the register name so you don't have to worry about the program architecture  

```bash
(gdb) info registers $pc
```

same as 

```bash
(gdb) i r $pc
```

You can set the asm flavor to intel
```bash
(gdb) set disassembly intel
```

Disassemble main function
```bash
(gdb) diassemble main
```

Quit
```bash
(gdb) quit
```


### [General Purpose Registers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Processor_register)
Think of a registers as a variable in the processor.  

EAX - Accumulator  
ECX - Counter  
EDX - Data  
EBX - Base  

The below ones are also general purpose registers but sometimes these are referred as pointers and indexes.  

ESP - Stack Pointer  
EBP - Base Pointer  
ESI - Source Index  
EDI - Destination Index  

EIP - Instruction Pointer  

Intel's flavor follows the following instruction format

operation \<destination>, \<source>  

move the value in rsp to rbp
```asm
mov rbp, rsp 
```

subtract 10 from the value in rsp
```asm
sub rsp,0x10
```
